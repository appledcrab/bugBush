#### Other features (not divided into ui or SQLite yet) More so ideas for right now
- [ ] Making a more interactive bug garden that isnt just a list of bugs
    - [ ] Filtering bugs in a list but also able to show bugs as visual bug emojis(?) in different bushes and hover over to show what bug that is
        - [ ] hopefully grouping bugs around similarity by filter (ex. project, tags); The bugs in the same bush more similar?
- [ ] Possibly adding bug to have permanent specific bug emoji to go along with it (maybe even to be chosen...?)
- [ ] Having a settings page or section that will change how it could operate
    - [ ] Random vs permanent bug emojis?
    - [ ] Changing set of emojis given to bugs
        - [ ] Even given emojis based on severity, status, project,
    - [ ] Background or title given color coded based on severity
