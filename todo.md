### Todos for this project:


#### SQLite
- [ ] Changing add bug function to take in a project and other tags on creation
    - [ ] Creating a project if project does not exist (selection on typing)
    - [ ] Creating new tag if tag does not already exist in table
- [ ] Testing basic CRUD of bugs 
    - [x] Test Create, Read
    - [ ] Test(+add) Update, Delete
- [ ] Possibly adding bug to have permanent specific bug emoji to go along with it (maybe even to be chosen...?)

#### Overall UI
- [X] Creating inital ui with python flask
    - [X] Creating base layout showing bugs and very simple button that works on adding bug
    - [ ] Changing bug input to add tags, project, and solution if it is a closed bug(ui and sqlite)
- [ ] Making a more interactive bug garden that isnt just a list of bugs
    - [ ] Filtering bugs in a list but also able to show bugs as visual bug emojis(?) in different bushes and hover over to show what bug that is
        - [ ] hopefully grouping bugs around similarity by filter (ex. project, tags); The bugs in the same bush more similar?
