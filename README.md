#### BugBush 

This project initally aims to help myself keep track of bugs in my projects.

Not only is this helpful for the interview question of any previous bugs you have encountered, but most importantly helps you keep track and remember of the previous bugs you've encountered.
Instead of going back through the rabbit holes of pages you went through to find your solution the first time, you can go back to what you wrote down before.

Yes, you could keep a bug journal with normal text file or other notes apps, but I hope to turn this into something that is specically utilized for bugs and learning.


##### Uses

- SQLite and keeping your bugs private to you/me.
    - could potentially think about hosting it and allowing making bugs public to help more people, but that will come alot later.
